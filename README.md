# Meet App

To build a serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a
test-driven development (TDD) technique. The application uses the Google
Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.

## USER STORIES

1. As a user, I should be able to filter events by city, so that I can see the list of events that take place in that city.
2. As a user, I should be able to click on a button that collapses or expands an event’s details, so that I can see more information about the event.
3. As a user, I should be able to type in how many events I want to see, so that I can filter how many events I want displayed.
4. As a user, I should be able to use the app when offline, so that I can still use the app even with no internet connection.
5. As a user, I should be able to see a chart displaying how many upcoming events are in a city so that I can more easily and quickly see the information I want about the events happening in each city.
